Benchmarks
==========

The following demonstrates the utility of Medaka's neural network in forming an
improved consensus from a pileup of reads.

Results were obtained using the default model provided with ``medaka``. This model
was trained using data obtained from E.coli, S.cerevisaie and H.sapiens samples.

Error statistics were calculated using the `pomoxis
<https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis>`_ program ``assess_assembly`` after
aligning 100kb chunks of the consensus to the reference. Reported metrics are
median values over all chunks. 


Comparison of `medaka` and `nanopolish` 
---------------------------------------

In this comparison the ``medaka`` E.coli :doc:`walkthrough` dataset was used.
These data were not used to train the model.  Basecalling was performed using
``Guppy v2.2.1``; both the older transducer and the newer flip-flop algorithm
were used for comparison. Basecalled reads were trimmed using `porechop
<https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop>`_ to remove adapters, and assembly was
performed using `canu v1.8 <https://github.com/marbl/canu>`_. The assembly was
corrected using `racon v1.3.1 <https://github.com/isovic/racon>`_ before being passed
to ``medaka`` or ``nanopolish``.  `nanopolish v0.10.1
<https://github.com/jts/nanopolish>`_ was run using :code:`--fix-homopolymers` option.

For this dataset the older transducer basecaller with ``medaka`` delivers
similar results to ``nanopolish`` in a fraction of the time. The flip-flop
workflow is seen to be superior to nanopolish. The runtime of ``medaka`` can be
reduced further by utilizing a GPU, the runtime with a NVIDIA GTX1080Ti is
found to be less than one minute!

A particular advantage of ``medaka`` over other methods is its improved
accuracy in recovering homopolymer lengths.

Evaluation across samples and depths
------------------------------------

The comparison below illustrates results at various coverage depths for a
collection of further organisms. Assemblies were performed as above with
canu and racon, using the ``Guppy v3.0.3`` high accuracy basecaller and
``medaka v0.6.5``.
